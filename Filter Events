# Write a program to get size of list and its elements and  to find numbers divisible by thirteen from a list using anonymous function (Lambda) and display those numbers.
# Input Format:
# The first line of input corresponds to the size of list 'n'.
# The next 'n' line of input corresponds to the elements in the list .
# Output Format:
# The output consists of numbers divisible by thirteen separated by space.
# Refer sample output for formatting specifications.
# Problem Constraints:
# n > 0 print the numbers divisible by thirteen separated by space, else display as "Invalid input".
# Sample Input/Output 1:
# Enter size of list
# 9
# Enter the elements in list
# 12
# 65
# 54
# 39
# 102
# 339
# 221
# 50
# 70
# 65 39 221
# Sample Input/Output 2:
# Enter size of list
# O


n = int(input("Enter size of list\n"))

if n <= 0:
    print("Invalid input") 

else:
    print("Enter the elements in list")
    numbers = []
    for i in range(n):
        numbers.append(int(input()))

    divisible_by_13 = list(filter(lambda x: x % 13 == 0, numbers))

    print(*divisible_by_13)
Invalid input
