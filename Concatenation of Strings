# Fun with “Strings” at Chicago technologies.
# The official heads of chicago technologies thought only working would tire the employees so they arranged some game for relaxation.
# Game 1:
# Rules were as follows:
# • String 1 should define the person and the first letter of the string 1 should be same as the first letter of String 2
# • String 2 should be the person’s name.
# • Output String should be the concatenation of both the input strings.
# Sample Input and Output 1:
# Enter the first string:
# Sleepy
# Enter the second string:
# Subhash
# Sleepy Subhash
# Sample Input and output 2:
# Enter the first string:
# Prem
# Enter the second string:
# Kabir
# Invalid Input

string = input("Enter the first string: ").strip()
string_2 = input("Enter the second string: ").strip() 

if string[0].lower() == string_2[0].lower():
    print(string + " " + string_2)

else:
    print("Invalid Input")
