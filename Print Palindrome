# James and Jones had a discussion on palindrome strings. They were assigned to a task in which they had to check if the given string is a palindrome or not and if not they had to make it as a palindrome.
#The condition for the task was as follows:
# â€¢ Input and output strings should be case sensitive.
# Help them with a program to make their task easier.
# Input format:
# Input consists of a string.
# output format:
# the output will be a palindrome string.
# Sample Input:
# Tamil
# Sample Output
# TamaT
# Sample Input:
# Amphi
# Sample Output
# AmpmA

string = input().strip()

if string == string[::-1]:
    print(string)

else:
    half = len(string) // 2
    if len(string) % 2 == 0:
        result = string[:half] + string[:half][::-1]
    else:
        result = string[:half+1] + string[:half][::-1]

    print(result)
