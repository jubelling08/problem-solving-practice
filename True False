##################
Write a python function which accepts three numbers and returns True if
a. one of the three numbers is "close" to any one of the other numbers (differing from a number by at most 2), and
b.Number that is left out is "far", differing from both other values by 3 or more.
Return false if the above mentioned conditions are not satisfied.
Sample Input 1:
5
0
3
Sample Output 1:
True
Sample Input 2:
5
6
7
Sample Output 2:
False

def close_far(a, b, c):
    # case 1: a and b are close, c is far
    if abs(a - b) <= 2 and abs(c - a) >= 3 and abs(c - b) >= 3:
        return True
    # case 2: a and c are close, b is far
    if abs(a - c) <= 2 and abs(b - a) >= 3 and abs(b - c) >= 3:
        return True
    # case 3: b and c are close, a is far
    if abs(b - c) <= 2 and abs(a - b) >= 3 and abs(a - c) >= 3:
        return True
    # otherwise, conditions not satisfied
    return False


# take inputs
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())

# print only the final result
print(close_far(a, b, c))
