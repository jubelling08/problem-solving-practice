# Regex pattern explanation:
# \b          → word boundary
# (?:[A-Z]\.)* → optional initials like "S." or "R.K."
# [A-Z][a-z]+  → a proper word starting with uppercase letter
# (?:\s[A-Z][a-z]+)* → optional surnames like "Kumar", "Watson"
pattern = r'(?:[A-Z]\.)*[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s[A-Z][a-z]+)*'

names = re.findall(pattern, text)

for name in names:
    print(name)
