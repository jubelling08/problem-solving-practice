# Write a program to find the GCD and LCM of two numbers using functions.
# Python Function Specification:
# def GCD (n1,n2):
# def LCM (n1,n2):
# Function should return the output.
# C Function Specification:
# int GCD (n1,n2):
# int LCM (n1,n2):
# Function should return the output.
# INPUT AND OUTPUT FORMAT:
# Input consists of two integers corresponding to two values.
# Output consists of two integers corresponding to GCD and LCM of the two numbers.
# SAMPLE INPUT AND OUTPUT:
# Enter two integers:
# 3
# 9
# Greatest common divisor of 3 and 9 = 3
# Least common multiple of 3 and 9 = 9
