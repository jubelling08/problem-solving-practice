Ishan playing aa simple game with alphabets. the procedure will be Ishan choose aa random number in between (0-26) and then he changed the alphabets in Ceaser chipper(Each letter 'shifted'  wrt chosen number).
So can you please help Ishan to write aa program for Ceaser cipher Encryption. Input and Output format Specifications are shown below.
Input Format Specifications:
The first line of Input contains a String.
The next line of input contains Integer N, N is the shifted positions number.
Replace all characters with the nth character from the current character.
 Must use "re.sub()".
Note: [" ord() expected a character, but a string of length 2 found" if the error shows like this then you use the lambda function ].
Output Format Specifications:
Output Consists of String.
if character addition is going greater than 127 then print ‘invalid’.
Sample Input and Output showed below.
Sample Input 1:
amphisoft
3
Sample Output 1:
dpsklvriw
Sample Input 2:
krishnamohan
27
Sample Output 2:
invalid

import re

# Input
text = input().strip()
n = int(input())

# Function to shift a single character
def shift_char(match):
    ch = match.group(0)
    new_val = ord(ch) + n
    if new_val > 127:
        raise ValueError("invalid")
    return chr(new_val)

try:
    # Replace every character with its shifted version
    result = re.sub(r".", lambda m: shift_char(m), text)
    print(result)
except ValueError:
    print("invalid")
